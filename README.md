# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe recreation that I made in Java. This project was made in my Freshman year in order to test and become more fluent in Java.

While made in my Freshman year, I only uploaded this project to Github after around a year. I hadn't uploaded it to Github, or even made it a Git repository in the first place due to my, at the time, limited experience and knowledge with the tools. Over the past year or so, especially this year, I have become much more proficient in Git and upon uncovering this project, decided that it may be nice to upload to Github, and will take limited effort to with my new proficiency.
